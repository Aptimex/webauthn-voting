    <p>This page provides a Register button for convenience. In reality, registration of voters' security keys should be performed securely prior to the availability of electronic ballot submissions. Attacks at the registration stage are outside the scope of this project. For simplicity this uses a passwordless authentication scheme, but using both (password and security key together; 2FA) is probably a better apprach in a real system.</p>
    <p>"Username" can be in any form the server is set up to handle. In a voting scheme where voter privacy needs to be maintained, this could be a random numeric code (chosen from a pool). The username (and an associated random registration password) could be digitally marked as "avaiable" at the time of voter regiration, but not digitally linked to the voter's identity. This would allow the voter to register their key to that username, ensure only validated voters can register keys, and preserve voter privacy. </p>
    <p>The Login button will (after a standard webauthn login process) redirect to the voting page. If a pending ballot for the voter is already in the system, it will instead redirect to the Verification page for convenience.</p>
    <p>It is assumed that in the event of a discovered manipulation, detected error, or just due to a change in mind at any time prior to the close of Internet voting that the registered voter can opt to use a traditional voting method instead, such as is currently available in many places with provisional ballots for cases when there is an issue with an absentee ballot. In this case a poll worker should be able to witness the voter succesfully logging in with their username and security key (on a known-good machine) as conclusive evidence that they are the owner of a particular ballot, and can proceeed with the alternative voting process. Exactly how an election authority decides to track and avoid counting such digital ballots that were already valid and verified is mostly a matter of policy, and has not been implemented here. </p>
    <p>Debug functionality at the bottom allows the various internal databases to be viewed to show things are working as intended.</p>
